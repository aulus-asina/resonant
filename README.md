# Resonant
A power worthy of Lord Zenos. Resonant is a Dalamud plugin that draws positional information in the world. 

![Target positionals with player hitbox](/repo/positionals.png)
## Features
### Player Hitbox
Pixel-accurate player position.
### Target Positionals
Draw the positional regions (flank, rear, front) around a target with a rich set of options. Also draws a range circle around the target for melee attacks (2.1 yalms) and melee abilities (3 yalms).
### Ring
Draw a ring at a distance around the player or target. Can be useful for raid buffs with a limited range or area attacks centered around the target.
### Player Cone
Draw a cone from the player towards the target. Useful for landing conal or directional attacks.
### Job Profiles
Keep separate profiles for different jobs.

## Installation
Add as a custom repository:
```

```

## Something doesn't seem right...
Mechanics such as how conal attacks work and how hitboxes and attack ranges work
have been inferred with trial and error. This plugin might be wrong about some
game mechanics - if something appears off let me know by opening a GitHub issue.
